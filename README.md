## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. We specifically compared the temperature trends between June and December. 
## Results
* The mean temperature in June is 3 degrees higher than in December.
* The lowest temperature recorded in December at 56 degrees was 8 degrees lower than June's lowest temperature at 64 degrees.
* The percentiles for each month favors June by 3-4 degrees.
## Summary
For determinining if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round, I think that there isn't a significant different between June and December. It is slightly warmer in June, but only by a few degrees. The temperature fluctuation is larger in December however, so there will by more variation in the temperatures that month. I would run an extra query on temperature to look at each quarter of the year instead of just June and December. I would also run a query looking at the precipitation in each month because it would be less busy if it were pouring rain.
